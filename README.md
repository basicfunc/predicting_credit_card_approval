# Predicting Credit Card Approvals
## Introduction
Credit card applications are commonly received by commercial banks, but many are rejected due to factors such as high loan balances, low income levels, or numerous credit report inquiries. Manually reviewing these applications can be tedious, prone to errors, and time-consuming. However, the use of machine learning can streamline this process and is utilized by most commercial banks. In this notebook, we will create a machine learning model to predict credit card approvals, similar to how it is done in real-life banks.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x (I used 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: `pandas, numpy and sklearn`
